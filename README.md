# SpaceX Mission Dashboard

## Overview
The SpaceX Mission Dashboard is a web application built with Angular that allows users to view and filter SpaceX mission data. The app fetches data from SpaceX's API and displays various details about each mission, including launch year, rocket name, and mission details. Users can filter missions based on the launch year, making it easier to explore the history of SpaceX's missions.

## Features

- **Year Filter**: Allows users to filter missions by their launch year. The filter updates the mission list based on the selected year.
- **Mission Details**: Users can click on a mission to view more detailed information about the mission, including mission details, rocket details, and links to related articles and videos.
- **Responsive Design**: The app is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes for a better user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: Angular
- **API**: SpaceX API (used to fetch mission data)
- **Styling**: Material Design (Angular Material)
- **Version Control**: Git and GitHub for version control
- **Deployment**: Vercel (for deployment of the web application)

# 101298914LabTest2Comp3133

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 19.2.5.

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:


ng serve


Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:


ng generate component component-name


For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:


ng generate --help


## Building

To build the project run:


ng build

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.
